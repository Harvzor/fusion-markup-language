# Fusion Markup Language

> One *markup language* to rule them all, One *markup language* to find them, One *markup language* to bring them all and in the darkness bind them

Fusion Markup Language combines the most popular markup languages into one language:

```fml
{
  "person": {
    <name>
      firstName: "Harvey"
    </name>
  }
}
```

Fusion Markup Language allows you to embed `json`, `xml` and `yaml` into the same file.

## Why?

When it comes to markup languages, developers are spoiled with choice:

- csv
- xml
- json
- yaml
- toml

It can be hard to decide which one to choose when starting with a project.

Fusion Markup Language attempts to provide a one-format-fits-all solution.
