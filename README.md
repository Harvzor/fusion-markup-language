# Fusion Markup Language

> One ~ring~ *markup language* to rule them all, One ~ring~ *markup language* to find them, One ~ring~ *markup language* to bring them all and in the darkness bind them

When it comes to markup languages, developers are spoiled with choice:

- csv
- xml
- json
- yaml
- toml

It can be hard to decide which one to choose when starting with a project.

Fusion Markup Language combines the most popular markup languages into one combined language:

```fml
{
  "person": {
    <name>
      firstName: "Harvey"
    </name>
  }
}
```
